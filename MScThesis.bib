	abstract = {There are many situations in logic, theoretical computer science, and category theory where two binary operations—one thought of as a (tensor) "product" , the other a "sum"—play a key role, such as in distributive categories and in *-autonomous categories. (One can regard these as essentially the AND/OR of traditional logic and the TIMES/PAR of (multiplicative) linear logic, respectively.) In the latter example, however, the distributivity one often finds is conspicuously absent: in this paper we study a "linearisation" of distributivity that is present in this context. We show that this weak distributivity is precisely what is needed to model Gentzen's cut rule (in the absence of other structural rules), and show how it can be strengthened in two natural ways, one to generate full distributivity, and the other to generate *-autonomous categories.},

We show that there is a bi-adjunction between the 2-categories of linearly distributive categories and linear functors, and of ∗-autonomous categories and monoidal functors, given by the construction of the “nucleus” of a linearly distributive category. We develop a calculus of proof nets for linear functors, and show how linearity accounts for the essential coherence structure of the exponentials and the additives. c 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper we consider the quotient F\_0(R)\_{\textbackslash}z of F(R)\_{\textbackslash}z by the relations {\textbackslash}qdet\_R(T\_i)=1, where {\textbackslash}qdet\_R is the quantum determinant associated to R (for rational, trigonometric, or elliptic R-matrices). This is also a Hopf algebra, which is a quantization of the group SL\_N[[t]]. This paper was inspired by the pioneering paper of I.Frenkel and Reshetikhin. The main goal of this paper is to study the representation theory of the algebra F\_0(R)\_{\textbackslash}z and of its quantum double, and show how the consideration of coinvariants of this double (quantum conformal blocks) naturally leads to the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations of Frenkel and Reshetikhin. Our construction for the rational R-matrix is a quantum analogue of the standard derivation of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations in the Wess-Zumino-Witten model of conformal field theory, and for the elliptic R-matrix is a quantum analogue of the construction of Kuroki and Takebe. Our result is a generalization of the construction of Enriques and Felder, which appeared while this paper was in preparation. Enriques and Felder gave a derivation of the quantum KZ equations from coinvariants in the case of the rational R-matrix and N=2.},

Tamarkin discovered that the operad of chains of the little discs operad is formal, i.e. it is homotopy equivalent to its cohomology. From this fact and from Deligne's conjecture on Hochschild complexes follows almost immediately my formality result in deformation quantization. I review the situation as it looks now. Also I conjecture that the motivic Galois group acts on deformation quantizations, and speculate on possible relations of higher-dimensional algebras and of motives to quantum ¢eld theories.},

	abstract = {We develop the deformation theory of cohomological field theories (in short, CohFTs), which is done as a special case of a general deformation theory of morphisms of modular operads. This leads us to introduce two new natural extensions of the notion of a CohFT: homotopy (necessary algebraic toolkit to develop chain-level Gromov–Witten invariants) and quantum (with examples found in the works of Buryak and Rossi on integrable systems). The universal group of symmetries of morphisms of modular operads, based on Kontsevich’s graph complex, is shown to be trivial. Using the tautological rings on moduli spaces of curves, we introduce a natural enrichment of Kontsevich’s graph complex. This leads to universal groups of non-trivial symmetries of both homotopy and quantum CohFTs, which, in the latter case, is shown to contain both the prounipotent Grothendieck–Teichmüller group and the Givental group.},

We establish this result by demonstrating that both GT and Gal\_Q are homeomorphic to the Cantor set, thereby unveiling a unifying topological framework for their study. This identification enables a recursive encoding of Gal\_Q via an explicit algorithm (the Cubic Matrioshka construction), that associates to each element of Gal\_Q (and similarly to GT and its GT-shadows) a unique infinite binary sequence. Such a combinatorial parametrization provides a new computational approach to the structure of these fundamental groups. To recover the arithmetic content lost in the passage to topology, we introduce a novel invariant: the Galois Grothendieck Path Integral. Inspired by the Feynman Path Integral, this construction encapsulates deep arithmetic information through correlation functions, offering a new perspective on the interplay between Galois symmetries, deformation theory, and quantum structures. As an application, we explore its potential role in a quantum model at the Planck scale.},

We define and introduce a version of a gravity operad constructed for a class of moduli spaces \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\_\{0,n\}\$, equipped with a hidden holomorphic involution. This additional symmetry is associated to a split quaternionic structure. We introduce a categorical framework to present this object. Interaction between the geometry, physics and the arithmetics are discussed. An important feature is that 0-divisors of the split quaternion algebra imply additional singular points, and lead to investigations concerning the geometry and mixed Hodge structures.},

It was solved by Meinrenken and the ﬁrst author over R, and in a formal version, by two of the authors over a ﬁeld of characteristic 0. In this paper, we give a simple and explicit formula for a map from the set of Drinfeld associators to the set of solutions of the formal KV equations. Both sets are torsors under the actions of prounipotent groups, and we show that this map is a morphism of torsors. When specialized to the KZ associator, our construction yields a solution over R of the original KV conjecture.},

These operads are central to the theory and appear in many applications.},

	abstract = {This monograph provides a coherent development of operads, infinity operads, and monoidal categories, equipped with equivariant structures encoded by an action operad. A group operad is a planar operad with an action operad equivariant structure. In the first three parts of this monograph, we establish a foundation for group operads and for their higher coherent analogues called infinity group operads. Examples include planar, symmetric, braided, ribbon, and cactus operads, and their infinity analogues. For example, with the tools developed here, we observe that the coherent ribbon nerve of the universal cover of the framed little 2-disc operad is an infinity ribbon operad. In Part 4 we define general monoidal categories equipped with an action operad equivariant structure, and provide a unifying treatment of coherence and strictification for them. Examples of such monoidal categories include symmetric, braided, ribbon, and coboundary monoidal categories, which naturally arise in the representation theory of quantum groups and of coboundary Hopf algebras and in the theory of crystals of finite dimensional complex reductive Lie algebras. Many illustrations and examples are included. Assuming only basic category theory, this monograph is intended for graduate students and researchers. In addition to being a coherent reference for the topics covered, this book is also suitable for a graduate student seminar and a reading course.},

The cyclicity is appropriately treated in a coherent way, i.e. up to coherent isomorphism. When the symmetric monoidal bicategory is specified to be a certain symmetric monoidal bicategory of linear categories subject to finiteness conditions, we prove that cyclic associative and cyclic framed little 2-disks algebras, respectively, are equivalent to pivotal Grothendieck-Verdier categories and ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier categories, a type of category that was introduced by Boyarchenko-Drinfeld based on Barr's notion of a \${\textbackslash}star\$-autonomous category. We use these results and Costello's modular envelope construction to obtain two applications to quantum topology: I) We extract a consistent system of handlebody group representations from any ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier category inside a certain symmetric monoidal bicategory of linear categories and show that this generalizes the handlebody part of Lyubashenko's mapping class group representations. II) We establish a Grothendieck-Verdier duality for the category extracted from a modular functor by evaluation on the circle (without any assumption on semisimplicity), thereby generalizing results of Tillmann and Bakalov-Kirillov.},
